## 1. What is DevOps
DevOps is nothing more than breaking the wall between development and operation to improve the efficiency and quality of software development, delivery, and deployment by using various of DevOps tools to achieve automation, continuous integration, delivery, deployment
The primary goal of DevOps is to foster teamwork between the development and operations teams so that they can may collaborate easily across the whole software development life cycle
## 2. What is a DevOps Engineer ?
DevOps engineers collaborate closely with IT operations teams, software developments, and other stakeholders to guarantee the effective delivery of software products.
To increase the efficiency and quality of software development, they are in charge of implementing automation, continuous delivery / deployment (CI/CD) practises.
Locate and resolve issues that arise thoughout the development process.
DevOps engineers often have extensive backgrounds in IT operations, systems administrator, software development, scripting, automation, and cloud computing skills. 
## 3. What do you know about DevOps and it's role?
Nowaday, Technologies are growing incredibly fast, end users have less toleration for downtime of an application. That why we need DevOps to minify the human errors, and automation, continuous development, testing, integration, deployment, monitoring of the software throughout the lifecycle.

## 6. Mentions some of the core benefit of DevOps
### technicle benefits:
> Continuous software delivery
> Less complex problems to manage
> Early detection and faster correction of defects
### production benefits:
> Faster delivery of features
> Stable operating environments
> Improve communication and collaboration between teams
## 7. What is the difference of CI and CD
CI:
. ensure the code can be safely deploy on to production
. Ensure business applications and services function as expected
. Delivers every change to a production-like environment through rigorous automated testing
CD:
.Every change that pass the automated tests is deployed to production automatically
. Make software development and release process faster and more robust
. There is no explicit approval from a developer and requires a developed culture of monitoring
